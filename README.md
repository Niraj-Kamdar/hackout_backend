# Hackout-backend
This is a decentralized BookStore server application.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites

You will need `python 3.x` installed

### Installing

After cloning/downloading this repository you have to install necessary packages from requirements.txt with following command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You will need a personal blockchain, which is a local development blockchain that can be used to mimic the behavior of a public blockchain. I recommend using [Ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache) as your personal blockchain for Ethereum development.

Now let's install the Truffle Framework, which provides a suite of tools for developing Ethereum smart contacts with the Solidity programming language.You can install Truffle with NPM in your command line like this.
```
 npm install -g truffle@5.0.2
```
